We have stayed at several four seasons around the globe, US several locations & Maldives. We weren't staying at the four seaosns but decided to go for dinner. First impression was that there was no greeting at the entrnace and we had to find our way to the bar area to have a drink before dinner. We had to wait 45 minutes to get served and others went straight to the bar and got served and left before they even took our drinks order - we were sitting adjacent to bar area. It didnt finish there. After being seated for dinner we order some beers for the 3 guys and they didnt arrive until 40 minutes and one spirit that we ordered didn't arrive at all. I'm not sure what is going on here but a real turn off and dissapointment. They did credit our drinks but the damage was done - the reason we go to the four seasons and pay pemium prices is to enjoy the premium attentive service and our expectaion is that this is consistent around the globe. Real dissapointing and advise any treavellers to give it a miss.
