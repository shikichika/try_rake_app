Upon departing to Japan I expected to find impeccable service and hospitality. However, even prior to our arrival, I was dissapointed.
Organising activities is extremely difficult with such an inattentive Concierge team.
Given the long time intervals between the answers of the team and our emails, we did not get to experience some of the wonderful things that the city has to offer; either because the tickets were sold out, or there had simply not been enough time to organise the activity. We began our contact with the team a month before our arrival.
The facilities and rooms are beautiful, however when something is spoiled by such a lack of care, it is hard to see its true potential.
